Description: High dimensionality, noise and heterogeneity among
    samples and omic features challenge the rational integration of
    molecular information. Here we present an implementation of sparse
    singular value decomposition (SVD) to deal with these limitations, by:
    a. Obtaining the main axes of variation of the data, to capture the
    source of independent information across omic blocks.  b. Imposing
    sparsity constraints at both subjects (rows) and features (columns)
    activities to remove excessive noise.  c. Using Elastic Net type of
    shrinkage, to balance between ridge and lasso types of penalty and
    allow the selection of groups of subjects or features potentially
    correlated.  d. Allowing both linear and non-linear projections (via
    t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) of the omic data to detect undesired
    sources of variation (e.g. batch and other artifact effects), and
    reveal cluster in very convoluted data.  e. Using the flexible
    framework of sparse SVD to extend the above ideas into unsupervised
    and supervised problems. References: 1.  Gonzalez-Reymundez A., Vazquez A.I. 2020.
